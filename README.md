# MiniLibC

Second year Epitech projet done in March 2021

## What works and doesn't

Everything works except for the strncmp which doesn't pass any tests.
The implementation for the strlen is also really bad, as I used repne and
it is kinda meh to use and will be rewritten.

## For Epitech students

Don't copy from here else you will just get flagged for cheating :)
(Especially if you're from Epitech Toulouse... I will find you myself ;) ).
